One possible list of contacts returned might be `delilah`, `justinn` and `Justin Lim`.

=== Authentication +
Users would be required to provide authentication to access the application. This is so as to ensure the privacy of the contact information within the application. +
Users would be prompted to sign up when they use the application for the first time. +
To change the password, users need only type the command `reset`. Users would then be prompted for the new password.

=== Integration with online Cloud Storage services +
Users would be able to store and synchronize their contacts in the application within popular Cloud Storage services such as Google Drive. +
Users would be required to provide authentication for the Cloud Storage services of their choice, and then any changes to the contacts of the application
would be synchronized with the copy within the Cloud service. +
This way, users would have a backup copy of their contacts. Users would also be able to access their contacts from other devices, bringing about portability.
