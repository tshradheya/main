This document explains the steps to perform manual testing, and how to load the sample data.

== Loading the Sample Data

The following are the steps to load sample data:

. Step 1
. Step 2
. ...

== Commands to Test

=== Filter
Command usage:
`filter [n/NAME] [t/TAG]`

* `filter n/Alex` +
Expected result: 2 person(s) listed!

* `filter t/friends` +
Expected result: 3 person(s) listed!

=== Toggle
Command usage: `toggle`

Toggles between the reminders panel and browser panel. Something to take note of is that if iContacts is currently
displaying the details panel, `toggle` would then bring out the reminders panel first, before alternating between
the reminders panel and browser panel.

Cases:

. `toggle` and iContacts is currently displaying the reminders panel. +
Expected result: Toggle successful. +
iContacts would now display the browser panel.

. `toggle` and iContacts is currently displaying the browser panel. +
Expected result: Toggle successful. +
iContacts would now display the reminders panel.

. `toggle` and iContacts is currently displaying the details panel. +
Expected result: Toggle successful. +
iContacts would now display the reminders panel.

=== Adding a reminder
*Please make sure to reload the sample reminder data before conducting the tests below to have accurate expected results.*

Command usage: `addreminder rd/REMINDER d/DATE ti/TIME`

To note: +
****
* All three parameters REMINDER, DATE and TIME must be filled. +
* DATE must be in the format dd/mm/yyyy. `'-'`, `'/'` and `'.'` can be used to separate the day, month and year field of the date,
 and they need not be paired up (i.e. 24.03/2017 is acceptable as well). The range of allowable dates is from 1900 to 2099. +
* TIME must be in 24-hr format, with a colon separating the hour and minute values. Example: 08:00, 16:00, 23:59. +
* REMINDER can be of any value, as long as it is not empty.
* If the event has passed, the reminder cell is colored in dark grey. +
* If the event is happening today, the reminder cell is colored in red. +
* If the event is happening within three days, the reminder cell is colored in yellow. +
* If the event is happening more than three days later, the reminder cell is colored in green. +
* The countdown to the date and time of the event, as well as the coloring of the reminder cell, *is not dynamic*. Both of these
are relative to the date and time the program is started up.
