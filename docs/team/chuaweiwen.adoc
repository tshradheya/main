== Project: iContacts
iContacts is an address book application with target audience as university students for managing contacts. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 8 kLoC. iContacts allow users to manage reminders, keep track of upcoming contacts' birthday, as well as share the contact list using the application's import and export mechanism.

This portfolio showcases the features and enhancements I have contributed to iContacts.
