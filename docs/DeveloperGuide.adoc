== Introduction

iContacts is an address book application with target audience as university students for managing contacts. This guide provides information for developers who wish to join our team as either developer or tester, and is intended to get you to understand the internal designs of the application, so that you will be able to work with the application quickly. The guide explains the design, implementation of noteworthy features, and the testing methods used in iContacts.

== Setting up

This section will guide you on setting up the development environment.

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has link:#gradle[Gradle] and link:#javafx[JavaFx] plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer.
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first).
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle.
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`.
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK.
. Click `Import Project`.
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`.
. Click `Open as Project`.
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings.
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all the resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands.
. link:#testing[Run the tests] to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

The following configurations need to be done before a developer starts writing the code. This is done to ensure that
the java coding styles and practices are followed.

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.md[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. Here are the steps to rectify the order:

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order:

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements.
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`.

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the links in the documentation will still point to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo. If you plan to develop this as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4`) , you should replace the URL in the variable `repoURL` in `DeveloperGuide.adoc` and `UserGuide.adoc` with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up link:#travis[Travis] to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

Optionally, you can set up link:#appveyor[AppVeyor] as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding, get some sense of the overall design by reading the link:#architecture[Architecture] section.

== Design

This section will explain the design aspects of iContacts.

=== Architecture

image::Architecture.png[width="600"]
_Figure 1 : Architecture Diagram_

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the application.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

Below is a quick overview of each component:

* `Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`], and it does the following:

** At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
** At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

* link:#common-classes[*`Commons`*] represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

** `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
** `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

* The rest of the App consists of four components:

** link:#ui-component[*`UI`*] : The UI of the App.
** link:#logic-component[*`Logic`*] : The command executor.
** link:#model-component[*`Model`*] : Holds the data of the App in-memory.
** link:#storage-component[*`Storage`*] : Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components:

*** defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
*** exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2 : Class Diagram of the Logic Component_


=== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3 : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)_

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4 : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)_

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event-Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

=== Components

This section explains the four components used in the App.

==== UI component

UI component provides with the API of Graphical User Interface. The figure below shows the structure of the UI component.

image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 5 : Structure of the UI component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All of these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`].

The `UI` component

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

==== Logic component
Logic component deals with how each command and its parser would be executed in an event-driven design. The figures below show the structure of the Logic component.

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 6 : Structure of the Logic component_

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 7 : Structure of Commands in the Logic component. This diagram shows finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in Figure 6_

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

*  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
*  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
*  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
*  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]
_Figure 8 : Interactions inside the Logic component for the `delete 1` command_

==== Model component
Model Component handles the contacts in address book and all it's stored details in data structures which provides API to create, read, update and delete the contacts in address book. The figure below shows the structure of Model component.


image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 9 : Structure of the Model component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<ReadOnlyPerson>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

==== Storage component
The storage component handles the storage of all data of address book in the local device. The figure below shows the structure of Storage component.

image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 10 : Structure of the Storage component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented, as well as design considerations for some features.

// tag::filter[]
=== Filter mechanism

The `FilterCommand` uses `NameAndTagsContainsKeywordsPredicate` to filter the persons with matching name and/or tags. It accepts `List<String> nameKeywords` and `List<String> tagKeywords` as parameters that are parsed by `FilterCommandParser`. Below is the constructor for the class:

[source,java]
----
public class NameAndTagsContainsKeywordsPredicate {
    public NameAndTagsContainsKeywordsPredicate(List<String> nameKeywords, List<String> tagKeywords) {
        this.nameKeywords = nameKeywords;
        this.tagKeywords = tagKeywords;
    }
}
----

The method `test(ReadOnlyPerson person)` iterates through `nameKeywords` and `tagKeywords` to find a match of every `person` from the address book.

Below is an extract of the method `test(ReadOnlyPerson person)`. The tags of each person are retrieved by the `getTags()` method. This method iterates through `tagKeywords` and counts the number of matches against `tagsOfPerson`. If the count is equal to the size of `tagKeywords`, this means all the keywords in `tagKeywords` matches. The `tagFound` will then be set to `true`.

[source,java]
----
public class NameAndTagsContainsKeywordsPredicate {
    @Override
    public boolean test(ReadOnlyPerson person) {
        boolean tagFound = false;

        int numTagKeywords = tagKeywords.size();
        int tagsMatchedCount = 0;
        if (!tagKeywords.isEmpty()) {
            tagsMatchedCount = countTagMatches(person);
        }

        if (tagsMatchedCount == numTagKeywords) {
            tagFound = true;
        }
    }
}
----

Below is an extract of the same method for name. Each keywords in `nameKeywords` will be compared against the name list retrieved from the person `getName()` method. If all matches, the `nameFound` will be set to `true`.

[source,java]
----
public class NameAndTagsContainsKeywordsPredicate {
    @Override
    public boolean test(ReadOnlyPerson person) {
        boolean nameFound = false;
            if (!nameKeywords.isEmpty()) {
                nameFound = nameKeywords.stream().anyMatch(nameKeywords -> StringUtil
                .containsWordIgnoreCase(person.getName().fullName, nameKeywords));
        }
    }
}
----

For the `FilterCommand` to work properly, either `nameKeywords` or `tagKeywords` must be non-empty.

// end::filter[]

// tag::export[]
=== Export mechanism

The `ExportCommand` uses `XmlAddressBookStorage` class to generate a xml file based on a given range and saves it to the path provided. It takes in two `String` values `range` and `path`. Below is the constructor for the class:

[source,java]
----
public class ExportCommand extends Command {
    public ExportCommand(String range, String path) {
        requireNonNull(range);
        requireNonNull(path);

        this.range = range;
        this.path = path;
        exportBook = new AddressBook();
    }
}
----

The method `getRangefromInput()` splits the String range using a seperator and returns a String array for the different values in the String range.

Below is an extract of the method `getRangefromInput()`:

[source,java]
----
public class ExportCommand extends Command {
    private String[] getRangeFromInput() {
        private String[] getRangeFromInput() {
            String[] splitStringComma = this.range.split(",");

            return splitStringComma;
        }
    }
}
----

To determine which contacts should be added to the exportBook we have to check the the user input. There are three cases:

* All (Priority)
** if the word `all` is present in the user input, we will just export all the contacts in the last shown list.
* Specific index (e.g. 1, 2, 3)
** if the user input contains a specific index we will add that index (one-based) to the `exportBook`.
* Range of indexes (e.g. 1-5,8-10)
** if the user input contains a range which is identified by `-` character, we will add that range of index (one-based) to the `exportBook`.

Below is the code snippet to identify the three cases in the user input:

[source,java]
----
public class ExportCommand extends Command {

    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() throws CommandException {
        String[] multipleRange = getRangeFromInput();

        if (multipleRange[0].equals("all")) {
            exportAll();
        } else {
            for (int i = 0; i < multipleRange.length; i++) {
                if (multipleRange[i].contains("-")) {
                    String[] rangeToExport = multipleRange[i].split("-");
                    exportRange(Integer.parseInt(rangeToExport[0]), Integer.parseInt(rangeToExport[1]));
                } else {
                    exportSpecific(Integer.parseInt(multipleRange[i]));
                }
            }
        }
        /... storage is resolved here ...
    }
}
----

The final step is to create the xml file from the `exportBook`.

Below is the code snippet to export the data into an xml file using `AddressBookStorage`.
[source,java]
----
public class ExportCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() throws CommandException {

    /... the exporting is resolved here ...

        try {
            AddressBookStorage storage = new XmlAddressBookStorage(path + ".xml");
            storage.saveAddressBook(exportBook);
        } catch (IOException ioe) {
            return new CommandResult(MESSAGE_EXPORT_FAIL);
        }
        return new CommandResult(MESSAGE_EXPORT_SUCCESS);
    }
}
----
// end::export[]

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo mechanism

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of the address book (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 11 : Inheritance diagram for commands_

As you can see from the diagram, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of the address book before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th person in the address book. The current state of the address book is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command).

image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 12 : Stack diagram after executing Delete command_

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new person.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 13 : Stack diagram after executing Add command_

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. We will restore the address book to the state before the `add` command executed.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 14 : Stack diagram after executing Undo command_

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 15 : Sequence diagram of the undo operation_

The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores the address book to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 16 : Stack diagram after executing Clear command_

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution:

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 17 : Stack diagram remains unchanged after executing List command_

The following activity diagram summarize what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="200"]
_Figure 18 : Activity diagram for UndoRedoStack_

[discrete]
==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `UndoableCommand` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()`. +
**Pros:** We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist. +
**Cons:** Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern. +
**Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()`. +
**Pros:** Does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand. +
**Cons:** Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

---

**Aspect:** How undo & redo executes +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book. +
**Pros:** Easy to implement. +
**Cons:** May have performance issues in terms of memory usage. +
**Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself. +
**Pros:** Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted). +
**Cons:** We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

---

**Aspect:** Type of commands that can be undone/redone +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modifies the address book (`add`, `clear`, `edit`). +
**Pros:** We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are lost). +
**Cons:** User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`. +
**Alternative 2:** Include all commands. +
**Pros:** Might be more intuitive for the user. +
**Cons:** User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of the address book and not the view. +
**Additional Info:** See our discussion  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].

---

**Aspect:** Data structure to support the undo/redo commands +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo +
**Pros:** Easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project. +
**Cons:** Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`. +
**Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo +
**Pros:** We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase. +
**Cons:** Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things. +
// end::undoredo[]

=== Display Picture Mechanism

The Display Picture mechanism is done by using ImageView in JavaFX which is a part of the UI Component. It is an undoable command that modifies the display picture for the specified contact. The command will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

The `displaypic` command adds/updates the display picture for the contact specified. The image is then displayed as ImageView in PersonCard.
The arguments of the command are `INDEX` and `PATHOFIMAGE`. The image needs to be present in the local device of the user.

This command works by retrieving the image using `BufferedImage`. The command extracts the image from the specified absolute path of image e.g. `C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\My files\pic.jpg`.
It then stores the image in the working directory's `\src\main\resources\images\` folder by giving it a unique hashcode based on user's email address.
The reading and writing of images is done using the `ImageIO` class.

The sequence diagram for adding a display picture is shown below: +

image::SDforDisplayPicture.PNG[width="800"]
_Figure 19 : Sequence Diagram for Display Picture Command._

The wireframe used to display the image for each person is shown below:

image::WireFramePersonCard.PNG[width="500"]
_Figure 20 : Wireframe for the UI._


The binder for refreshing the image every time the picture is updated is implemented by the following function:

[source,java]
----
public class PersonCard extends UiPart<Region> {
    private void assignImage(ReadOnlyPerson person) {
        // ... assigning image logic ...
        displayPicture.setImage(image);
    }
}
----

The new image stored in directory is given a unique name which is formed using hashcode of the unique email address of each contact:

[source,java]
----
public class DisplayPictureCommand extends UndoableCommand {

    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() throws CommandException, IOException, URISyntaxException {
        /... executes function of ReadAndStoreImage ...
        ReadAndStoreImage readAndStoreImage = new ReadAndStoreImage();

        displayPicture.setPath(readAndStoreImage.execute(displayPicture.getPath(),
                            personToEdit.getEmail().hashCode())); // image name formed in this line
    }
}
----

The command is implemented in this manner because of the following reasons:

* By specifying the index, there is no ambiguity as to who should be assigned the display picture.
* The `PATHOFIMAGE` must be an absolute path on the local device to make sure the image is referenced.
* The image is stored in directory with a unique name to avoid conflict. Hashcode of user's email address is used to maintain uniqueness.
* The task is done using CLI to follow project requirements.
* The image is stored in jpg format to ensure maximum compatibility.

[discrete]
==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** At what stage should the image be read and stored +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Invoke 'ReadAndStoreImage' from Logic component.  +
**Pros:** We will be able to get the contact's address for unique hash code.  +
**Cons:** Difficult for new developers to understand the sequence diagram and flow. +
**Alternative 2:** Invoke 'ReadAndStoreImage' from Model component. +
**Pros:** Easier for new developers to understand the sequence diagram and maintains event-driven nature. +
**Cons:** There might be clashes in naming of two different images for large database of contacts.

---

**Aspect:** How should the image be taken from user +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** User has to enter the absolute path of image by checking his local device.   +
**Pros:** Complete CLI process  +
**Cons:** Might be problematic for user to copy and paste and might result in error of path giving fail command. +
**Alternative 2:** Pop up a `FileChooser` after command is entered. +
**Pros:** Easier for users to mention the correct image quickly. +
**Cons:** Will no longer be a CLI process completely.

=== Location mechanism
The location command through an event-driven mechanism. The below diagram shows sequence diagram for it.

image::locationSD.PNG[width="790"]
_Figure 21 : Sequence diagram for the Location Command._

The execution of command raises an event `ShowLocationEvent`. This causes the `BrowserAndReminderPanel` to switch to Node `Browser` irrespective of current state of the application. The activity diagram for such a case is shown below:

image::locationAD.PNG[width="790"]
_Figure 22 : Activity diagram for the Location Command._

Following is the code written to ensure the GUI set up for the command.

[source, java]
----
private void setUpToShowLocation() {
    if (currentlyInFront == Node.REMINDERS) {
        browser.toFront();
        currentlyInFront = Node.BROWSER;
        raise(new TurnLabelsOffEvent());
    }
}
----

The URL for denoting the specified person's address in Google Maps is set up through the following code

[source, java]
----
public String loadPersonLocation(String address) {

        String[] splitAddressByWords = address.split("\\s");

        String keywordsOfUrl = "";

        for (String word: splitAddressByWords) {
            keywordsOfUrl += word;
            keywordsOfUrl += "+";
        }

        loadPage(GOOGLE_MAPS_URL + keywordsOfUrl);
}
----


[discrete]
==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** What to use to show the location +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Show using google maps url in BrowserPanel  +
**Pros:** We will be able to get the location easily with accuracy +
**Cons:** Limited functionality of URL +
**Alternative 2:** Google Maps API +
**Pros:**  Allows more functionality +
**Cons:** Uses more resources for the exact same feature and doesn't utilise pre existing browser properly


=== Email mechanism

The email command lets the user compose an email in default browser with filled in data like recipients, subject and body.

[NOTE]
The recipients are all contacts belonging to a particular tag.
[NOTE]
The only two services offered are `gmail` and `outlook` as our target users are students.

The email command through an event driven mechanism. The below diagram shows sequence diagram for it.

image::emailSD.PNG[width="790"]
_Figure 23 : Sequence diagram for the Email Command._

The given command is parsed to know the `Service` , `tag` to which email has to be sent, `Subject` and `Body`.

The parsing takes place in the following manner:

image::ParserSDEmail.PNG[width="790"]
_Figure 24 : Sequence diagram for parsing the Email Command._


The execution of command raises an event `SendingEmailEvent`.

The URL for composing the mail set up through the following code

[source, java]
----
public static final String GMAIL_EMAIL_URL =
            "https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&fs=1&tf=1&source=mailto&to=%1$s&su=%2$s&body=%3$s";

public static final String OUTLOOK_EMAIL_URL =
            "https://outlook.office.com/?path=/mail/action/compose&to=%1$s&subject=%2$s&body=%3$s";

Desktop.getDesktop().browse(new URI(String.format(GMAIL_EMAIL_URL, recipients, subject, body)));
----

[discrete]
==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Where to compose the mail +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Opens the default browser of Desktop  +
**Pros:** The browser has user already signed up and browser supports the url +
**Cons:** Depending on third party apps +
**Alternative 2:** Open in `BrowserPanel` +
**Pros:** No dependency on other apps +
**Cons:** Does not auto fill in the text due to older version of browser


=== Toggling mechanism
The toggling mechanism is an event-driven mechanism.

image::togglingMechanism1.png[width="790]
_Figure 25 : Component interactions for the toggling mechanism._

The above diagram shows the high-level overview of the component interactions for the toggling mechanism. +

image::togglingMechanism2.png[width="790"]
_Figure 26 : Sequence diagram for the first part of the toggling mechanism._

As seen from the sequence diagram above, when the user type the command for toggle, an instance of `ToggleCommand` would be instantiated. Upon execution by `LogicManager`, the event `BrowserAndRemindersPanelToggleEvent` would be posted by the `EventCenter`, to the `EventBus`:


[source, java]
----
public class ToggleCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        EventsCenter.getInstance().post(new BrowserAndRemindersPanelToggleEvent());
        // ... return some object or null ...
    }
}
----


As seen from the diagram below, the method `handleBrowserToggleEvent()` in the `BrowserAndRemindersPanel` class in the `UI` component will then listen for the event,
and upon receiving the event, it will invoke the method `toggleBrowserPanel` to trigger the actual toggling.

image::togglingMechanism3.png[width="790"]
_Figure 27 : Sequence diagram for the second part of the toggling mechanism._

The `BrowserAndRemindersPanel` class has a variable `currentlyInFront` keeping track of which panel (browser or reminders) is currently being shown.
`toggleBrowserPanel` would then use the `currentlyInFront` variable to toggle to the correct panel, and then update `currentlyInFront` appropriately:

[source, java]
----
public class BrowserAndRemindersPanel extends UIPart<Region> {
    @Subscribe
    private void handleBrowserPanelToggleEvent(BrowserAndRemindersPanelToggleEvent event) {
        logger.info(LogsCenter.getEventHandlingLogMessage(event));
        toggleBrowserPanel();
    }

    private void toggleBrowserPanel() {
        switch(currentlyInFront) {
        case BROWSER:
            birthdayList.toFront();
            currentlyInFront = Node.REMINDERS;
            raise(new TurnLabelsOnEvent());
            break;
        case REMINDERS:
            browser.toFront();
            currentlyInFront = Node.BROWSER;
            raise(new TurnLabelsOffEvent());
            break;
        default:
            //... Should not come to the default case ...
        }
    }
}
----

As seen from the code snippet above, two other events `TurnLabelsOnEvent` and `TurnLabelsOffEvent` can still be raised.
When the browser is being brought to the front, the *birthdays* and *reminders* heading just above the list of birthday reminders and
reminders should be turned off. When the reminders panel is brought to the front, these heading should be turned on. The handling of these two events
are in the `HeaderPane` class, where the variables `birthdays` and `reminders`, representing the `Label` header object for birthday reminders and reminders
respectively, are turned on and off by simply setting their visibility appropriately:

[source, java]
----
public class HeaderPane extends UIPart<Region> {
    @Subscribe
    private void handleTurnLabelsOffEvent(TurnLabelsOffEvent event) {
        logger.info(LogsCenter.getEventHandlingLogMessage(event));
        birthdays.setVisible(false);
        reminders.setVisible(false);
    }

    @Subscribe
    private void handleTurnLabelsOnEvent(TurnLabelsOnEvent event) {
         logger.info(LogsCenter.getEventHandlingLogMessage(event));
         birthdays.setVisible(true);
         reminders.setVisible(true);
    }
}
----

One important thing to note that when the `select` command is executed, the browser panel would be brought forward no matter what:

[source, java]
----
public class BrowserAndRemindersPanel extends UIPart<Region> {
    @Subscribe
    private void handlePersonPanelSelectionChangedEvent(PersonPanelSelectionChangedEvent event) {
        logger.info(LogsCenter.getEventHandlingLogMessage(event));
        loadPersonPage(event.getNewSelection().person);
        bringBrowserToFront();
        raise(new TurnLabelsOffEvent());
    }

    private void bringBrowserToFront() {
        browser.toFront();
        currentlyInFront = Node.BROWSER;
    }
}
----

As seen from the code snippet above, the `PersonPanelSelectionChangedEvent` is posted whenever the `select` command is executed. Within the `handlePersonPanelSelectionChangedEvent`
method, there is the method `bringBrowserToFront`, which would then bring the browser panel to the front no matter what.

=== Reminder Implementation
image::RemindersUML.png[width="790"]
_Figure 28: UML diagram showing the implementation of reminders_

The `Reminder` object represents a reminder in iContacts. It contains a `String` variable, which represents
the actual reminder from the user, and also a `DueDate` object which represents the date and time for the reminder. +

In terms of how `Reminder` objects are kept in-memory during the execution of the program, `Reminder` objects are
kept within `UniqueReminderList`, which assures that there are no duplicate `Reminder` objects. The `UniqueReminderList`
object is then kept and used by `ModelManager` to carry out commands related to reminders while the program is running. +

`Reminder` objects are stored in a XML storage file in a JAXB-friendly version `XmlAdaptedReminder`.
When the program starts, `XmlAdaptedReminder` objects are read in as `XmlSerializableReminders` via `XmlFileStorage` and `XmlUtil`.
This can be seen below:

[source, java]
----
public class XmlFileStorage {

    public static XmlSerializableReminders loadRemindersFromSaveFile(File file) throws DataConversionException, FileNotFoundException {
        try{
            return XmlUtil.getDataFromFile(file, XmlSerializableReminders.class);
        } catch (JAXBException e) {
            throw new DataConversionException(e);
        }
    )

}
----

The `XmlSerializableReminders` object is then passed to `UniqueReminderList`, which then converts it into a list of `Reminder` objects for in-memory use.
This can be seen below:

[source, java]
----
public class UniqueReminderList implements Iterable<Reminder> {
    public UniqueReminderList(XmlSerializableReminders xmlReminders) {
        requireNonNull(xmlReminders);
        try {
            setReminders(xmlReminders.toModelType());
        } catch (DuplicateReminderException dre) {
            assert false : "Reminders from storage should not have duplicates";
        }
    }

    public void setReminders(List<Reminder> reminders) throws DuplicateReminderException {
        final UniqueReminderList replacement = new UniqueReminderList();
        for (final Reminder reminder : reminders) {
            replacement.add(new Reminder(reminder));
        }
        setReminders(replacement);
    }

    public void setReminders(UniqueReminderList replacement) {
        this.internalList.setAll(replacement.internalList);
    }
}
----

To save, the `saveReminders` method in `StorageManager` is invoked:

[source, java]
----

@Override
    public void saveReminders(UniqueReminderList reminderList) throws IOException {
        saveReminders(reminderList, remindersStorage.getRemindersFilePath());
    }

@Override
    public void saveReminders(UniqueReminderList reminderList, String filePath) throws IOException {
        logger.fine("Attempting to write to data file: " + filePath);
        remindersStorage.saveReminders(reminderList, filePath);
    }

----

This will then invoke the `saveReminders` method in `XmlRemindersStorage`, and go on to invoke the `saveRemindersToFile` method in `XmlFileStorage`,
and the `saveDataToFile` method in `XmlUtil`.

[discrete]
==== Design Consideration
**Aspect:** How to store Reminders in-memory +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store Reminder objects in UniqueReminderList, independent of AddressBook +
Pros: Makes more sense, because a Reminder should not be part of AddressBook +
Cons: More changes have to be made to the existing program, making it tougher to implement +
**Alternative 2:** Store Reminder objects within AddressBook +
Pros: Does not make sense +
Cons: Easier to implement

=== Theme-changing mechanism

image::themeChangingMechanism1.png[width="790"]
_Figure 29 : Component interactions for the theme-changing mechanism_

The theme-changing mechanism is an event-driven mechanism. The above diagram shows the high-level overview of the component interactions for the theme-changing mechanism.

image::themeChangingMechanism2.png[width="790"]
_Figure 30 : Sequence diagram for the first part of the theme-changing mechanism_

As shown from the sequence diagram above, after the user entered the command `theme sky`, a new object `ThemeCommand` will be created. The `LogicManager` will then execute `ThemeCommand`, and the event `ChangeThemeRequestEvent` will be posted by `EventsCenter`. The code snippet below shows the `execute()` method of `ThemeCommand`:

----
public class ThemeCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        EventsCenter.getInstance().post(new ChangeThemeRequestEvent(theme));
        return new CommandResult(String.format(MESSAGE_SET_THEME_SUCCESS, theme.getTheme()));
    }
}
----

image::themeChangingMechanism3.png[width="790"]
_Figure 31 : Sequence diagram for the second part of the theme-changing mechanism_

As shown from the sequence diagram above, the method `handleChangeThemeEvent()` in `MainWindow` will handle the event and change the theme of the address book through the method `changeTheme()` accordingly.
// end::theme[]

// tag::find[]
=== Find mechanism

The `FindCommand` uses `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` to find contacts with matching names or nicknames. It accepts `List<String> nameKeywords` as the parameter that is parsed by `FindCommandParser`. Below is the constructor for the class:

[source,java]
----
public FindCommand(NameContainsKeywordsPredicate predicate) {
        this.predicate = predicate;
    }
----

The method `test(ReadOnlyPerson person)` iterates through `nameKeywords` to find a match with the name or nickname of every `person` from the address book.

Below is an extract of the method `test(ReadOnlyPerson person`.

[source,java]
----
   @Override
    public boolean test(ReadOnlyPerson person) {
        return keywords.stream()
                .anyMatch(keyword -> StringUtil.containsWordIgnoreCase(person.getName().fullName, keyword))
                || keywords.stream()
                .anyMatch(keyword -> StringUtil.containsWordIgnoreCase(person.getNickname().value, keyword));
    }
----

For the `FindCommand` to work properly `nameKeywords` must be non-empty. The code extract below checks for empty inputs:

[source,java]
----
    public FindCommand parse(String args) throws ParseException {
        String trimmedArgs = args.trim();
        if (trimmedArgs.isEmpty()) {
            throw new ParseException(
                    String.format(MESSAGE_INVALID_COMMAND_FORMAT, FindCommand.MESSAGE_USAGE));
        }

        String[] nameKeywords = trimmedArgs.split("\\s+");

        return new FindCommand(new NameContainsKeywordsPredicate(Arrays.asList(nameKeywords)));
    }
----
// end::find[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See link:#configuration[Configuration]).
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level.
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application.
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution.
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App.
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size.

=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`.
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`.

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`).

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`).

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

*  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
** _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
** _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
*  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
**  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
**  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
**  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size). +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers).

[appendix]
== Target Users

This application is targeted towards University students, aiming to meet their needs throughout their university life, and hopefully beyond. University students meet many people in the university, such as project group members, tutors, lecturers, friends and other connections. Nowadays it is important for students to build connections with other people, as connections may also help students for their future career after graduation. Since the students meet a lot of people, they may not be able to remember all the information about the people they met. Therefore, iContacts aims to help students to store and manage their contacts easily.

*  User Profile

**  University Student
**  Student part of many CCA clubs and committees
**  Student taking role of Teaching Assistant/Tutor
**  Student who is interning and has colleagues
**  Student having close friends and family
